# Blockchain-Based Travel Booking System

## Overview

This mobile application leverages blockchain technology and smart contracts to provide a secure, transparent, and efficient travel booking experience. [cite: 1, 20, 21] It consists of two main modules: a User module for travelers and an Admin module for authorized personnel. [cite: 2, 3, 4]

## Features

* **User Module:**
    * User registration and login. [cite: 69, 70]
    * Securely upload personal information and required documents. [cite: 4, 5, 70]
    * Browse travel schedules and seat availability. [cite: 72]
    * Request tickets using a unique token ID. [cite: 7, 71]
    * Receive ticket confirmations. [cite: 72]
* **Admin Module:**
    * Admin login. [cite: 74, 75]
    * Manage travel schedules and seat availability. [cite: 3, 75]
    * Verify user documents and booking requests. [cite: 76, 77]
    * Allocate tickets to users. [cite: 77]

## Technologies Used

* Blockchain: For secure, tamper-proof, and decentralized data storage. [cite: 5, 9]
* Smart Contracts: To automate and enforce booking rules and data handling. [cite: 5, 22]
* Ganache:  To store and verify proofs of user data and transactions. [cite: 6, 7]
* Flutter:  For building the mobile application (Note: the document also mentions JAVA, J2EE, JSP, Android, but Flutter is listed as well, so assuming that's the primary focus). [cite: 82, 224, 225, 226]
* Firebase: For database management and authentication. [cite: 82]
* Android Studio:  The IDE used for development. [cite: 82]

## System Architecture

The system architecture involves:

1.  Users registering and uploading documents. [cite: 69, 70]
2.  Smart contracts storing data on the blockchain and generating unique IDs. [cite: 94, 95]
3.  Users requesting tickets with their IDs. [cite: 95]
4.  Admins verifying user data and allocating tickets. [cite: 76, 77]
5.  The blockchain ensuring secure and transparent data management. [cite: 121, 122, 123, 124, 125]

## Key Benefits

* **Enhanced Security:** Blockchain's decentralized nature and smart contracts ensure data integrity and protect against tampering. [cite: 25, 66]
* **Increased Transparency:** All transactions and data are recorded on the blockchain, providing a transparent and auditable record. [cite: 9, 26]
* **Improved Efficiency:** Automation through smart contracts streamlines the booking process. [cite: 61, 62]
* **Reduced Fraud:** Secure verification processes and tamper-proof records help minimize fraudulent activities. [cite: 27, 330]

## Setup Instructions

_(Provide detailed instructions on how to set up the project, including dependencies, installation steps, and configuration.  This is crucial for other developers to run your code.  Example structure below)_

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Flutter SDK installed
    * Android Studio installed
    * Node.js and npm (for Ganache CLI, if applicable)
    * Ganache CLI or Ganache GUI installed
    * Firebase account and project set up
2.  **Installation:**
    * Clone the repository.
    * Navigate to the project directory.
    * Run `flutter pub get` to install Flutter dependencies.
    * Set up Firebase configuration (add your `google-services.json` or configure manually).
    * Start Ganache.
    * Deploy the smart contracts to Ganache (provide specific deployment instructions).
3.  **Configuration:**
    * Update any necessary environment variables or configuration files.
    * Configure the Firebase connection in the Flutter project.
    * Ensure the smart contract addresses are correctly referenced in the application.
4.  **Running the Application:**
    * Run `flutter run` to launch the application on an emulator or connected device.

## Smart Contract Workflow

1.  Users upload their data, which is stored on the blockchain via a smart contract. [cite: 94]
2.  The smart contract generates a unique ID for the user. [cite: 95]
3.  Users request tickets using this ID. [cite: 95]
4.  Admins verify the user's ID and data on the blockchain. [cite: 76]
5.  Tickets are allocated if the verification is successful. [cite: 77]

## Future Enhancements

* Scalable blockchain solutions for higher transaction volumes. [cite: 326]
* Biometric or multi-factor authentication. [cite: 327]
* Support for more travel services and platforms. [cite: 328]
